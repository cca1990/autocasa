# autocasa
This webapp is a prototype that i'm making to provide a service to people to sell vechiles and real state stuff in a really basic way. It needs like a ton of refactoring. Data was gathered with a simple HtmlUnit webcrawler that I did.

Created with Spring Boot and using h2 in memory db. You can take a look at http://autocasa.herokuapp.com/.
